# AI-Generated Image Detection

I created a project that focuses on **detecting images generated by AI**.

In recent years, the rise of generative models such as **GANs** and **Diffusion Models** has enabled AI to create images that look extremely realistic. While this opens opportunities in art, media, and education, it also raises serious risks in misinformation, image manipulation, and identity fraud.  
This project aims to build a system that can **automatically distinguish real images from AI-generated ones**, contributing to a safer and more trustworthy digital environment.

## Project Highlights

- **Custom Dataset**
  - **10,000 real images** from **CelebA-HQ**.  
  - **10,000 fake images** generated by **StyleGAN2**, **Realistic Vision (a Stable Diffusion variant)**, and **ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com**.  
  - Applied **Data Augmentation** (flipping, rotation), expanding the dataset to **80,000 images**.

- **Deep Learning Model**
  - Used **EfficientNet-B1**, a CNN model optimized for both accuracy and efficiency.  
  - Around **7.8M parameters**, trained with normalization, weight decay, and data preprocessing.  
  - Loss function: **CrossEntropyLoss**, Optimizer: **Adam**.

- **Training & Results**
  - Trained on GPU with **10 epochs**, batch size = 32.  
  - Achieved accuracy up to **99% (in-dataset)** and around **90% (out-of-dataset)**.  
  - Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.  

- **Big Data Integration**
  - Used **Hadoop Streaming with Python** to calculate dataset-wide statistics (mean & std) for normalization.  
  - Enabled efficient preprocessing and improved model convergence.

## Future Development

- Extend dataset with more AI-generated sources (MidJourney, DALLÂ·E, etc.).  
- Explore **Transformer-based** and **Vision-Attention** models.  
- Build a **web demo** where users can upload images and get instant predictions.  
- Combine image detection with **metadata analysis** for multi-level fake detection.  
- Optimize the model for **mobile deployment** to detect fakes on the go.
